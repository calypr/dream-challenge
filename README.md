# Overview 🌀

Development + testing repo for WDL workflow benchmarking for the AnVIL Dream Challenge

## Quick Start ⚡

```sh
➜ TODO
```

## Benchmarking

> TODO

## Notes ✍️

Docs WDL-workflow scaling/sharing for Dream Challenge: 
  - Working with Walsh on initial docs + timeline: 3-4 months
  - Involves protected data (held out training sets)
  - CM4AI.org
  - Try running WDL workflows on AnVIL

Timeline Steps:
  - Setup Dream challenge
  - Announce publically
  - Get particpants Submit models
  - Talk about in Summer
  - Close out in November
  - Choose winner + write paper

- Use AnVIL for submission
- Run compute (using Cromwell on AnVIL)
- Write benchmark in framework on AnVIL
- Make leader board on Synapse
- 100 submissions max

- Second website that can query AnVIL (via Service Account) + run jobs (via Synapse)
- Framework should be minimal as possible
- Participants submitting workflows (not results)
- Should be private (not visibile to other teams)
